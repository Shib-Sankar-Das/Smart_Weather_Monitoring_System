# Smart Weather Monitoring System üå§Ô∏è

A real-time weather monitoring system using the ESP8266, the New Blynk app, DHT11 for temperature and humidity, BMP180 for atmospheric pressure, a rain sensor, and an LDR for light detection. This project displays weather data on an LCD and sends it to the Blynk app for remote monitoring.

## Introduction üìñ

This Weather Monitoring System allows users to monitor weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, pressure, rain, and light levels remotely via the Blynk IoT platform. Using various sensors and the Blynk app, you can keep track of real-time weather changes, enhancing the system's utility for smart agriculture, environmental monitoring, and IoT applications.

## Approach üí°

1. **Sensor Integration**: We use DHT11, BMP180, rain, and LDR sensors for capturing weather data.
2. **Data Processing**: The ESP8266 processes and uploads the data to the Blynk cloud.
3. **LCD Display**: A 16x2 I2C LCD shows real-time weather data locally.
4. **Blynk App**: The Blynk IoT platform provides a dashboard to remotely monitor data and set notifications.

## Usability üõ†Ô∏è

- **Agriculture**: Monitors weather conditions for optimal farming conditions.
- **Smart Home**: Can be integrated into home automation systems for weather-based actions.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracks environmental changes in real-time for research or safety measures.
- **Educational Tool**: A great project for students to learn IoT and embedded systems.
